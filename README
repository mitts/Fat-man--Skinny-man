One day fat man and skinny man were walking along, when they noticed that a 
plane carrying a shipment of bombs for the army and a plane carrying cheese 
collided mid air. Bombs and cheese began raining down upon them. Make sure 
Skinny man doesn't get hurt by the bombs, and also don't forget to feed Fat man

fat man controls:
w - jump
a - left
s - duck
d - right
space - perform ability (pick up, then eat cheese)

skinny man controls:
up arrow - jump
left arrow - left
down arrow - duck

Quick reminder: Fat man is immune to the bombs, but he's also
a lot slower than Skinny man.
